The module demonstrates a way to create telegram bots using the pyTelegramBotAPI library (https://pypi.org/project/pyTelegramBotAPI/).

It is already possible to create a bot that sends notifications, for this you need to use the bots_creator module

There are plans to modify the module to a bot constructor with a graphical interface, which will make it faster and easier to create bots. And bots with simple logic and no programming at all.
