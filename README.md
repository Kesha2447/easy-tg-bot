The module demonstrates a way to create telegram bots using the pyTelegramBotAPI library (https://pypi.org/project/pyTelegramBotAPI/#writing-your-first-bot ).

There are plans to modify the module to a bot constructor with a graphical interface, which will make it faster and easier to create bots. And bots with simple logic and no programming at all.
